      <description>I’m launching a new scientific notebook using blogdown, following the install instructions at https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/workflow.html and using Yihui’s Xmin theme. I modified some stuff in layouts/ to get syntax highlighting and to show tags and categories.
The example posts are still there for now, though I can safely delete them as they can be found elsewhere.
I’ve set up a netifly account to automagically build the site, and serve it at brucekendall.</description>

      <description>XMin is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the blogdown book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal.</description>
