<p>I’m launching a new scientific notebook using blogdown, following the install instructions at <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/workflow.html" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/workflow.html</a> and using Yihui’s Xmin theme. I modified some stuff in <code>layouts/</code> to get syntax highlighting and to show tags and categories.</p>
<p>The example posts are still there for now, though I can safely delete them as they can be found elsewhere.</p>
<p>I’ve set up a netifly account to automagically build the site, and serve it at brucekendall.netifly.com.</p>
