I'm launching a new scientific notebook using blogdown, following the install instructions at https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/workflow.html and using Yihui's Xmin theme. I modified some stuff in `layouts/` to get syntax highlighting and to show tags and categories.

The example posts are still there for now, though I can safely delete them as they can be found elsewhere.

I've set up a netifly account to automagically build the site, and serve it at brucekendall.netifly.com.
